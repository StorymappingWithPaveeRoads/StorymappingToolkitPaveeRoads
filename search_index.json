Stories can be told in many different ways, and having the ability to show where our stories take place can add and important and powerful dimension to stories. While all stories indicate some kind of place and location, storymaps allow for explicit showing of the travelling through places in linear narratives. In other words, storymaps allow us to focus on the where of our stories. The term Storymap, sometimes written as StoryMap, as a term has recently become a shorthand description for online, interactive, linear storytelling built around a map or multiple maps. The maps change as you read them, and often scrolling through the map progresses the story and changes where the map focuses, what is on the map, or introduces other different types of media, including pictures, videos, audio-recordings and more. In this storymapping toolkit, you will find all the steps to create and design your first storymap. This toolkit includes a guide to all of the technical steps to locating the places, adding descriptions, text and images and creating a fully designed spatial narrative. In addition, this toolkit includes a guide and discussion of how to use storymaps to uniquely tell spatial stories, and how you can design your storymap to showcase places the usefulness of the storymap format. The guide requires only that you have a browser and a Google account. Some familiarity with Google Sheets or spreadsheets will be helpful, but the guide will also include instructions on all aspects of the storymapping process. Also accompanied with this written guide are videos of each step of the storymapping process. These can be a helpful addendum or primary resource for carrying out the steps.

There are many different types of software and techniques that can be used to make storymaps, and deciding the form and tools is a major decision point in the storymapping project. In this toolkit guide, you will be using a storymapping tool and templates made by Jack Dougherty and Ilay Ilaynkou for their textbook Hands-On Data Visualisation. There are other storymapping tools discussed in later chapters of this toolkit. Dougherty and Ilyankou set out ten aspects to take into account in choosing the tool: Easy to learn Free or affordable Powerful Supported Portable Secure and Private Collaborative Cross-Platform Open-Source Accessible for Visually-Impaired Readers (2022) These are all important to consider not only in choosing the tool, but also in how the tool is used. And for a quick summary of the storymaps made using this template: they focus on a good balance of these considerations, and are importantly relatively easy to learn and free. Explore below the storymap made by Michael Collins, in collaboration between the Pavee Roads Home project at Pavee Point and the Maynooth University Geography Department. The link to the storymap in the context of the project can be found here. What can you observe from the map? The main narrative occurs in the text and images that you can scroll through. Each narrative is separated into chapters. And each chapter is linked to a specific view of the map. This view centres on a specific point on the map, and also has a set zoom, so the author has control not only over where the map is showing but also the context in the map. Does the map show landmarks and distances over one kilometre? Over one hundred kilometres? These are decisions you will be able to make as the storyteller and mapmaker. 2.1 Exploring your first storymap - the template For your first storymap in this toolkit, you will be building off of a template provided to you.
