Stories can be told in many different ways, and having the ability to show where our stories take place can add an important and powerful dimension to stories. While all stories indicate some kind of place and location, storymaps allow for explicit spatial narratives - travelling through places through time. In other words, storymaps allow us to focus on the where of our stories. The term storymap, sometimes written as StoryMap, as a term has recently become a shorthand description for online, interactive, spatial storytelling built around a map or multiple maps. The maps change as you read them, and often scrolling through the map progresses the story and changes where the map focuses, what is on the map, or introduces other different types of media, including pictures, videos, audio-recordings and more. In this storymapping toolkit, you will find steps to create and design a storymap. This toolkit includes a guide to the technical steps to locating the places; adding descriptions, text and images; and creating a fully designed spatial narrative. In addition, this toolkit includes a guide and discussion of how to use storymaps to uniquely tell spatial stories, and how you can design your storymap with the unique usefulness of the storymap format. The guide requires only that you have access to a web-browser - Chrome, Firefox, Edge or others - and a Google account. Some familiarity with Google Sheets or spreadsheets will be helpful, but the guide also includes instructions on how to use spreadsheets for the storymapping process. Also accompanied with this written guide are videos of each step of the storymapping process. These can be a helpful addendum or primary resource for carrying out the steps. In addition, the guide includes a discussion of the advantages and disadvantage of the template used in this example, and how other types of storymaps work differently. To proceed, click on the arrow to the right to go to the next chapter, or select the chapters on the left menu.

In this toolkit guide, you will be using a storymapping tool and templates adapted from Jack Dougherty and Ilay Ilyankou work textbook Hands-On Data Visualisation. Their storymapping approach is a good balance of advantages for storymapping. Dougherty and Ilyankou set out ten aspects to take into account in choosing the tool: Easy to learn Free or affordable Powerful Supported Portable Secure and Private Collaborative Cross-Platform Open-Source Accessible for Visually-Impaired Readers (2022) These are all important to consider not only in choosing the tool, but also in how the tool is used. The storymaps in this this toolkit have a good balance of these considerations, and are importantly relatively easy to learn and free. Explore below the storymap made by Michael Collins, in collaboration between the Pavee Roads Home project at Pavee Point and the Maynooth University Geography Department. The link to the storymap in the context of the project can be found here. What can you observe from the map? The main narrative occurs in the text and images that you can scroll through. Each narrative is separated into chapters. And each chapter is linked to a specific view of the map. This view centres on a specific point on the map, and also has a set zoom, so the author has control not only over where the map is showing but also the context in the map. Does a map chapter show landmarks and distances over one kilometre? Over one hundred kilometres? These are decisions you will be able to make as the storyteller and mapmaker. 2.1 Exploring your first storymap - the template For your first storymap in this toolkit, you will be building off of a template provided to you. You can see what the storymap template looks like here. All of the information of the storymap can be changed by you, the storymap author. This includes changing the title, the description, the points on the map, the zoom on the map for each chapter, and the descriptions, images, and more that you can show in the text on the left side of the storymap window. All of the data in a storymap can be added and edited in a Google Sheet. This is a spreadsheet, similar to Microsoft Excel, that can be viewed and edited in the browser and is hosted online by Google. For our storymapping approach, all of the data for each storymap comes directly from a corresponding Google Sheet. Everytime you change something in the sheet, that change will be reflected in the map. 2.2 Editing with the two tabs - Storymap and Sheet To edit the storymap, it is best to have two tabs open in a browser window. One tab will be the storymap page, where you will be able to quickly see all the changes you make, and the other tab will be the Google Sheet Once you have a numbered storymap assigned, click on the two corresponding links below to open up the storymap you will be working on, and the Sheet where you will edit data. (For example, if you have been assigned number 3, click on the Storymap 3 and Storymap Sheet 3 links). Storymap Link Google Sheet Storymap link 1 Storymap Sheet 1 Storymap link 2 Storymap Sheet 2 Storymap link 3 Storymap Sheet 3 Storymap link 4 Storymap Sheet 4 Storymap link 5 Storymap Sheet 5 Storymap link 6 Storymap Sheet 6 Storymap link 7 Storymap Sheet 7 Storymap link 8 Storymap Sheet 8 The Google Sheet contains all of the data for the storymap, and currently contains all the data to make the map template. When you first open the Google Sheet link, you will see the list of chapters in the map. If you are unfamiliar with Google Sheets or other spreadsheets, this may be confusing at first. With some explanation, we can simplify what we are looking at, how to interpret it and how to change it. Begin by observing the tabs at the bottom of the screen. One of these tabs is labeled Options, and by clicking here we can get a sheet where we can change many of the extra settings for the storymap and add the title, subtitle, author and other details.
